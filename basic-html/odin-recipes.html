        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <p>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).<br>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half
        and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard
        seeds.<br>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender,
        about 5 minutes. Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
        Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is
        hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.<br>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves
        through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking
        dish. Pour water into the baking dish.<br>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup
        mint leaves over the zucchini and top with the bread crumb mixture. Continue baking until the top is crusty
        and browned, about 10 minutes more.<br></p>
